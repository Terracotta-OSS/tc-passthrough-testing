/**
 * Accesses PassthroughServer instances by URI.
 * The named server must first be registered in the shared PassthroughServerRegistry shared instance for the host name given
 * in the URI.  A URI of the shape "passthrough://serverName" will attempt to resolve the server registered as "serverName".
 * 
 * The special concern to realize, regarding our use of passthrough, is that we will treat an entire stripe (an active and
 * any number of corresponding passives) as the same "named" PassthroughServer.  Even if this changes, it should always be
 * sufficient to describe a stripe as a "name", instead of worrying about individual servers within a stripe (since there is
 * no network).
 * 
 * Note that this ConnectionService is only accessible if "org.terracotta.passthrough.PassthroughConnectionService"
 * is listed in "META-INF/services/org.terracotta.connection.ConnectionService".
