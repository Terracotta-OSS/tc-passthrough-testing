/**
 * Maintains the association that a connection has to its server and the in-flight messages associated with it.
 * The reason why this is managed out-of-line is that reconnect represents very specific ordering concerns and thread
 * interaction concerns, which are far more easily managed within a distinct object.
 * Note that all the methods in this object are synchronized so they can not block for any reason other than waiting.  That
 * is to say that nothing can perform a blocking operation while holding the monitor.
